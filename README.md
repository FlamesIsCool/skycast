# SkyCast

SkyCast is a simple client-side weather website that uses the OpenWeather API. It includes a basic login and registration flow implemented entirely in the browser using `localStorage`.

## How to Use

1. Open `public/index.html` in a web browser.
2. Register a new account on the registration page.
3. Log in with your credentials.
4. After logging in, you will be taken to the dashboard where you can search for the current weather by city name.
5. Use the logout button to end your session.

## Note
This example is for demonstration purposes only. Credentials are stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so do not use real passwords. To deploy on the web, serve the files in the `public` directory using any static file server.
